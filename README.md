The Mandate:
Each team starts the game with an amount of 5% of the total asset value with which they can purchase risk protection across various asset classes. The asset portfolio is provided to each team along with the useful life of the asset,assuming linear deprecation. (e.g. a 10 year useful life implies that the asset would have lost 80% of its value at the end of 8 years)

Associated with each asset is a set of risks that could impact that asset. Of course there is no certainty of that particular risk materializing in a particular year, but a set of research reports and catastrophe models (100 years of event occurrence pattern shared with the team) could give some indication. Based on these inputs, each team is expected to strategize to
allocate their premium across their asset base and maximize the Net Asset Value. Each year, Assets that get wiped out due to an event which was not covered will not be available for subsequent rounds(years). The team that gets the maximum cumulative value of assets across 5 years wins the game.
